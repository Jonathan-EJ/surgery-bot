            <h3> Motivation </h3>
            <p> The Da Vinci system, one of the famous Robotic Surgical Assistants (RSA), has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgeries by facilitating procedures that are aggressively demanding of a surgeonâ€™s skill, effort, and energy. 
              However, this system still requires humans to control the robot to execute the motion. Therefore, we are looking forward to automating the process of wound suturing by automatingthis process with Baxter.

            <h3> Objectives </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Design a gripper that will hold the <b>suture needle</b> in reference to the Baxter's end effectors</li>
              <li>Design a <b>scaled-up patient model</b> that mimics flesh and blood as well as being able to be penetrated by the suturing needle</li>
              <li>Use <b>computer vision and image segmentation</b> to detect an open wound in real time, find points of interest for suturing, and to detect the closure of the wound</li>
              <li>Implement a <b>path planner</b> for Baxter to generate trajectories to pass the needle from arm to arm without getting tangled</li>
