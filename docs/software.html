              <p>To start up the Surgery Robot, run_planning.launch and run_vision.launch is run. 
                These launch files start up the necessary nodes such as the trajectory action server and the Realsense camera.
              </p>
              <p>After the required nodes are up, suture.py is run.</p>
              <p>The robot proceeds to calibrate its grippers and ask the user to place the needle into its grip and to ready the patient in its workspace.</p>
              <p>The robot then assumes its rest position and ask the user for the number of sutures the user would like the robot to perform.</p>
              <p>The user then selects the desired points of entry in RVIZ using the Publish Point Tool.</p>

              <p>To generate the suture trajectories, 6 key poses are used.
                These poses are grouped into 2 set: entry and exit.</p>
              <p>The entry set consists of the entry, insert, and release poses.
                The entry pose defines the pose of before the needle is inserted into the patient.
                The insert pose defines the pose of needle insertion.
                The release pose defines the intermediary pose before the robot returns its rest pose.
                These pose are used exclusively by the left gripper.</p>
              <p>The exit set consists of the entry, insert, and release poses.
                The grip pose defines the pose for the gripper to interact with the needle.
                The exit pose defines the pose where the needle completely exits the patient.
                The return pose defines the intermediary pose before the robot returns its rest pose.
                These pose are used exclusively by the right gripper.</p>
              <p>The rest pose the robot assumes is used to hand over the needle before performing the next suture.
                This a sideways pose was chosen to provide more clearance since the Baxter wrist are quite large.</p>
