            <h2>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND DESIGN CRITERIA</h2>
            <p>
                Our measure of success ended up being Baxter accomplishing one stitch at the correct locations and correct right and left arms coordination. 
                This measure was chosen through many trials and observing that after one stitch was made, various problems began to emerge that inevitably showed through in the second suture almost every time. 
                For example, no motion path could be found and Baxter eventually killed itself. 
                Overall, we're proud of where our project is right now. 
                Several simplifications had to be made to create a result similar to the intended one, but we have some ideas of improvements that would get us closer to our original goal in creating an automated surgical robot that would ease the demand of surgeons.

          <h2><u>Future Direction</u></h2>
          <ul> 
              <li>Implementing computer vision with image segmenting to pick up needles instead of handing needles to Baxter.</li>
              <li>Find a better way to <b>integrate Realsense vision</b> to Baxter, since it would enhance the path planning loop a lot. </li>
              <li>Implementing a <b>circular trajectory</b>, as is done in real suturing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><u>Challenges Encoutered</u></h2>
          <ol>
              <li><b>ABORTED: NO MOTION PLAN FOUND</b>
                  <p>This error also frustrated us a lot along with our progress and Baxter also doesn’t like doing suturing rather killed itself every time we tested. 
                      We tried manually publishing points from PointCloud in RViz and minimized our motion constraints. </p>
              </li>
              <li><b>Revisions with Vision and Image Segmentation</b>
                  <p>K-means segmenation did not perform well.</p>
              </li>
              <li><b>Error Type Placement</b></li>
              <li><b>AR Tag on Table, Camera Repositioning</b></li>
              <li><b>Calibration (Baxter frame, Realsense frame, tf... etc)</b></li>
              <li><b>Integrating and Designing with Baxter</b></li>

          <h2><u>Societal and Social Impact</u></h2>
          <p>When looking at the bigger picture of the project design, robotic surgery has a large scale impact on improving healthcare through cutting edge technology. 
            As of now the main robotic surgery device in the market is the da Vinci surgical system, which allows for three-dimensional imaging and vision, intricate procedures and motions and most importantly costs over $2 million. 
            The technology we’ve created is at a lower cost than this and allows for the completion of basic surgical tasks such as suturing which can be more applicable rather than just minimally invasive surgeries which that current surgical system is used for. 
            A huge benefit of incorporating robotic surgery into medicine is that a doctor in America could be performing a surgery on a patient in a low resource hospital in India. 
            Robotic surgery does come with a higher cost then potentially employing just a doctor or healthcare professional however it does allow for large social impact of providing high quality of care to countries and areas that may not have access to it through this virtual form of surgical connection. 
            All in all there are still a lot of improvements and groats that can be done in this field and companies like Medtronic and J<span>&#38;</span>J are at the forefront of these innovations. 
            Our project allows for us to understand the applications of electrical engineering, computer science and robotics into a field that involves patient care, public health and global health.</p>
