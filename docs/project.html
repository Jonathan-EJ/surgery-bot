                <h3>Initial Idea</h3>
                <p> 
                    The project goal is to create a robot that can perform suturing on a patient during surgery. 
                    Using Baxter, we plan to use its cameras and grippers to perform surgery on a scaled up patient. 
                    We will use computer vision to locate suture entry points and to ensure the wound is closed. 
                    As for the design criteria, the robot must be able to detect the color of red fabric to identify the place where the cut needs to be closed. 
                    It will also need an image segmentation mechanism to determine whether the cut is closed. 
                    The robot must also have the trajectory motion be similar to a sewing motion including an orientation constraint. 
                    This can be done through a path planning algorithm and with the help of computer color vision to determine how much distance the needle needs to travel from one end of the wound to the other. 
                    The robot must also knot the thread once the cut is closed or senses other conditions we set for a stop on sewing. 
                    There will be a gap between the internal (red) part and outer skin (pink), and a cotton will be stuffed in the gap to simulate a fat tissue and make suturing easier. 
                    Using a computer vision algorithm, we plan to progressively close the cut from one side. 
                    We plan to find the suturing spots automatically; however, if that turns out to be difficult, we hope to assist it by manually determining the spots and “tattoo” them on the patient.
